It is a new Copernican Revolution where things are studied and understood from the point of view of citizens, and taking into account their diverse perspectives. \n\nThe main goal of DataScientia is to generate and share knowledge about people, society and the world, as seen and described by people. Our ultimate goal is to analyze and understand the <i>diversity of people<\/i>, e.g., how location and time, language, culture, competences, skills, opinions and goals, as well as their deeper <i>unity<\/i>, namely, what we all share across diversity and enables going below the surface of diversity.\nDataScientia collects person-centric data and makes them available as <i>a common good<\/i>. By <i>person-centric<\/i> data we mean <i>personal<\/i> data, but also the <i>language<\/i> we talk, <i>knowledge<\/i>, <i>data<\/i> and <i>media<\/i> about our <i>culture<\/i> and the <i>world<\/i> and <i>events<\/i> around us. We call <i>person-centric<\/i> data any type of data, generated by people for people, for their own needs and goals. \nWe do not aim for objectivity. Rather, we want to study how local objectivity emerges and how different local objectivities can be integrated and composed into <i>purpose-driven<\/i> <i>unitary<\/i> representations of the world. The focus is on the <i>process <\/i>of data generation, integration and composition, and on keeping track of the process by which diversity, with its infinitely many dimensions, generates purpose-driven representations of the world.\n\nWe all live in our own world which is different from that of everybody else. Perception creates it, language allows to share its description with the other people, thus causing its objectivation, knowledge is what we come to learn about it by observing what repeats itself through change, as described by language. \nThis process has been in place for centuries, most likely since the dawn of the human kind. The novelty is that Internet has exponentially increased the possibility, for all of us, to get exposed to new people, speaking different languages and holding different knowledge, cultures and traditions. This increased exposure to the diversity of people provides us with an unprecedented wealth of opportunities for learning and innovation, while, at the same time, putting us in front of our limited capability to understand and absorb such richness.\nUnderstanding the diversity of people and their underlying Unity is key for a sustainable AI based evolution.\n\nWe want to enable a process where people increase their level of awareness and active participation to the current AI technological innovation. Technological innovation should be driven by social innovation, and citizens should proactively participate to the definition of the social innovation agenda.\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About Us Who are we\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Community\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Organization\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Data\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manifesto DataScientia is a Citizen Science community of people who &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/about-us-2\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">About Us-Who<\/span> Read More \u00bb<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_uag_custom_page_level_css":"","site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":""},"uagb_featured_image_src":{"full":false,"thumbnail":false,"medium":false,"medium_large":false,"large":false,"news_plugin_small":false,"news_plugin_full":false,"1536x1536":false,"2048x2048":false},"uagb_author_info":{"display_name":"admin","author_link":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/author\/admin\/"},"uagb_comment_info":0,"uagb_excerpt":"About Us Who are we\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Community\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Organization\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Data\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manifesto DataScientia is a Citizen Science community of people who&hellip;","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/13464"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/9"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=13464"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/13464\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13661,"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/13464\/revisions\/13661"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=13464"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
