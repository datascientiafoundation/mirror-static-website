Decades and even centuries of biases \u2014 along with a few new ones \u2014 are probably baked into all that material.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">BERT and its peers are more likely to associate men with computer programming, for example, and generally don\u2019t give women enough credit.
