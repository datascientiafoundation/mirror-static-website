Our ultimate goal is to analyze and understand the diversity of people, e.g., how location and time, language, culture,competences, skills, opinions and goals&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tWhy do we do what do we do?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>We all live in our own world which is different from that of everybody else. Perception creates it, language allows to share its description with the other people, thus causing its objectivation, knowledge is what we come to learn about it by observing what repeats itself through change.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tWhat do we hope to achive?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>We want to enable a process where people increase their level of awareness and active participation to the current AI technological innovation.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tWho are the members of our community?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>Anybody can be a member of the Community. You do not need any specific skills to become a member. The only requirement is that you must be willing to learn about AI and its impact on society and to invest some effort in this<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tHow can you contribute?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>There are at least three types of contribution. You can choose the one which best fits your competence, skills and interests:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can provide data as needed in one of the many experiments that we set up<\/li>\n<li>Participate to the open-source community, in charge of development of the AI tools and software that allows DataScientia to operate.<\/li>\n<li>Help us in the management of one of the DataScientia local communities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>\n\t\tHow do we help you contribute?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>There are four main ways we can help you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We provide with educational, mainly online, material which will provide the basics of AI and its impact on society<\/li>\n<li>We will help you in learning how to collect, store and manage the person-centric data that you generate<\/li>\n<li>We will help you to use AI towards learning how to understand person-centric data<\/li>\n<li>We will teach you how to use the DataScientia tools and software for data collection, understanding and also exploitation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/datascientia.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/people_grid.jpg\" alt=\"people_grid\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"800\"
