What is new in this meeting<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We meet again a bit over one year after the kickoff meeting of 2019. Back then we introduced three main areas of Datascientia research &#8211; Behavioural\/Language\/Knowledge Diversity &#8211; and we launched a Behavioural Diversity capturing tool: i-Log, to be used by DataScientia partners for organizing experiments that generate research ready datasets about different human problems; like physical activity, traffic, academic performance, food intake,\u00a0 pollution, among others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year we meet again to share the great success of our launched initiative (with experiments in Paraguay, Mexico, China and soon more) and confidently go beyond as we announce our second major launch &#8211; Linguarena, in the Language Diversity area &#8211; that will lead us in the direction of capturing, managing and leveraging the language diversity around the world.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The meeting is organized along the lines of four main categories:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Behavioural Diversity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: introduction and progress related to our ongoing i-Log initiative, along with discussions of its evolution, future potential and collaborations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Language Diversity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: launch of the Linguarena initiative with an in-depth look to its principles, research goals and implemented tools being made offered to Datascientia partners from that day on.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Knowledge Diversity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: we will discuss their possibilities, value\u00a0 and progress made on our Liveschema initiative.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Teaching and dissemination<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: starting this year, we are organizing major mixed online and participatory courses related to the main Datascientia initiatives. This will surely become an important tool for gaining traction in academic environment and getting people interested in our work.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Our Datascientia<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: we will refresh the main values, principles and objectives that guide Datascientia and discuss how to work together to effectively collaborate towards them.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4><b>3.
