It examined state-of-the-art language technologies, such as deep-learning-based machine translation and cross-lingual transfer, pointing out their limited ability in tackling language diversity, i.e. local specificities in language and culture. It then presented recent research from KnowDive on language resource generation that is able to understand and explicitly represent such phenomena, such as lexical gaps within the <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.theguardian.com\/digital-language-divide\/\">Universal Knowledge Core<\/a> lexical database, <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.theguardian.com\/digital-language-divide\/\">cognates<\/a>, or large- scale <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.theguardian.com\/digital-language-divide\/\">wordnets for endangered languages<\/a>.
