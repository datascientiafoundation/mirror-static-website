Perception creates it, language allows to share its description with the other people, thus causing its objectivation, knowledge is what we come to learn about it by observing what repeats itself through change, as described by language. This process has been in place for centuries, most likely since the dawn of the human kind.<br \/>\nThe novelty is that Internet has exponentially increased the possibility, for all of us, to get exposed to new people, speaking different languages and holding different knowledge, cultures and traditions. This increased exposure to the diversity of people provides us with an unprecedented wealth of opportunities for learning and innovation, while, at the same time, putting us in front of our limited capability to understand and absorb such richness.<br \/>\nWe believe that the ongoing digital globalization of social interactions will cause a singularity in the development of society. The mission of DataScientia is to study, understand, compare, unify and empower the diversity of people, how it appears in the data in Internet. The vision is that the knowledge generated will enable a more open, more inclusive and better society while, at the same time, paving the way to the understanding of the unity which provides the substrate of our same existence. The approach is computational with a leading strong inter-disciplinary dimension. The choice of universities as the driving case study is motivated by their being the cradles of our future.\n<a href=\"http:\/\/disi.unitn.it\/~fausto\/\">Fausto Giunchiglia<\/a><br \/>\nMunich Airport<br \/>\nThursday July 26, 2018<br \/>\n<a href=\"localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/datascentia_flyer.pdf\">Download Vision and Mission<\/a>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vision and Mission We all live in our own world which is different from that of everybody else.
