Our ultimate goal is to analyze and understand the diversity of people, e.g., how location and time, language, culture,competences, skills, opinions and goals&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tWhy do we do what do we do?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>We all live in our own world which is different from that of everybody else. Perception creates it, language allows to share its description with the other people, thus causing its objectivation, knowledge is what we come to learn about it by observing what repeats itself through change.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tWhat do we hope to achive?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>We want to enable a process where people increase their level of awareness and active participation to the current AI technological innovation.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tWho are the members of our community?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>Anybody can be a member of the Community. You do not need any specific skills to become a member. The only requirement is that you must be willing to learn about AI and its impact on society and to invest some effort in this<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tHow can you contribute?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>There are at least three types of contribution.
